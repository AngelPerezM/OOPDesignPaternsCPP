# OOPDesignPaternsCPP
In this proyect I will implement in C++ some design patterns examples based on the books "Head First Design Patterns" and "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".

Directory Structure: The design patterns examples are classified by the "purpose" criterion (i.e. creational, structural and behavioral).
