# OOPDesignPaternsCPP
In this proyect I will implement in C++ all the design patterns examples based on the book Head First Design Patterns and Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software from the GoF.

The design patterns examples are classified by the "purpose" criterion (i.e. creational, structural and behavioral).
